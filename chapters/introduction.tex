\chapter{Introduction}
Today people are able to access and share information with others in a way that was not even imaginable back to some decades ago. The rise of the internet has changed how we live, how we work, and how we communicate. This was also more clear at the start of this decade because of coronavirus epidemy that forces many of us to limit our social life and use the internet to work from home and keep in contact with friends. The main reason why the internet joined our life is that we can have a reasonable level of privacy over thanks to tools that invisibly work under the hood of every message we send and websites we visit. This is not the only environment where cryptography is used. One of the earliest uses dates back two thousand years when Julius Caesar developed a way to send secret military messages to his commanders. Cryptography also had a main role in World War I and mostly in World War II, where each nation had his own cipher to send military information to ally. The most famous was the Enigma machine used by Germany to encrypt the messages. After years of works, the English mathematician Alan Turing was able to decode the messages sent by germans and bring a huge advantage to Allied. Historians have estimated that this fact has reduced the duration of the war by about two years. Since then and with the evolution and spread of computers, cryptography had to adapt to the enormous computational power we have today and be accessible to everyone and not just military and national agencies. In this paper is explained which cryptographic tools are used, how they are constructed, and which type of security they give to conclude with the introduction of a commonly used protocol named HTTPS.
