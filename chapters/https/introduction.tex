Private and public key schemes, as well as digital signatures, can be found in many protocols used over the Internet to create secure communication channels. One of them is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), which is the extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It's widely used on the Internet in the communication between browsers and web servers. Many reasons justify the necessity for a secure protocol; indeed, HTTP is vulnerable to eavesdropping, tampering, and other attacks that can be carried out with a MITM. HTTPS assures that, in the communication between a web browser and a web server, an attacker can't interfere.
