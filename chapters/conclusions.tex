\chapter{Conclusions}
Cryptography has been a protagonist over the years and becomes more and more relevant as Internet usage increases. As computers continue to get more powerful and algorithms to become more efficient, new steps in the cryptography need to be made, guaranteeing the security that we need. Problems like factoring are not yet proven to be computationally hard, while P $\neq$ NP is still an open problem. Moreover, quantum computers are becoming a reality and the cryptography world will have to move to post-quantum cryptography. Until now, computationally hard mathematical problems are the best and most effective ways to encrypt data and ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.
