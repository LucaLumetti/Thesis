Cryptography has been the protagonist over the years and always became more relevant. As computer continue to get powerful, algorithms to become more efficient, new steps in the cryptography need to be made, guaranteeing the security that we need. Problems like factoring are not yet proven to be hard as well as P $\neq$ NP is still an open problem. Moreover, quantum computers are becoming a reality and the cryptography world will have to move to post-quantum cryptography. Until now, computationally hard mathematical problems are the best and effective way to encrypt data.
