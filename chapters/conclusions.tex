\chapter{Conclusions}
Cryptography has been protagonist over the years and always became more relevant. As computer continue to get powerfull algorithms become more efficient, new steps in the cryptography needs to be made guarantee the security we need. Problems like factoring is not yet proven to be hard as well as P $\neq$ NP is still open. Moreover, quantum computers are becoming a reality and the cruptography world will have to move to post quantum cryptography. Until now, computationally hard mathematical problems are the best and effective way to encrypt data.
