\section{Pseudorandom Permutations}
Pseudorandom functions are functions that map n-bit strings to n-bit strings and that cannot be distinguished from a random permutation chosen, uniformly, from every function that map n-bit strings to n-bit strings.
The first set of functions, for a key of length $s$ bits, has a cardinality of $2^{s}$, while the second set has a cardinality of $2^{n\cdot2^n}$.\par
Pseudorandom permutations are pseudorandom functions with some extra proprieties:
Let $F : \{0,1\}^{n} \times \{0,1\}^{s} \rightarrow \{0,1\}^{n}$ be an efficient, length-preserving, keyed function and $F_k(m) := F(m, k)$.
$F$ is a pseudorandom permutation (PRP) if:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{$\forall k \in \{0,1\}^{s}$, $F$ is a bijection from $\{0,1\}^{n}$ to $\{0,1\}^{n}$}.
    \item{$\forall k \in \{0,1\}^{s}$ exists an efficient algorithm $F^{-1}_k$.}
    \item{For all probabilistic polynomial-time distinguishers\footnote{A distinguisher is a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm that output $1$ if he thinks that input function is truly random, $0$ otherwise} $D$:
        $$
            |\mathsf{Pr}[D^{F_k}(n) = 1] - \mathsf{Pr}[D^{f_n}(n) = 1]| < \mathsf{negl}(n)
        $$
        where $k$ is chosen uniformly at random from $\{0,1\}^{s}$ and $f_n$ is chosen uniformly at random from the set of every permutations on n-bit strings.
        }
\end{itemize}
