\section{Authentication}
In a cryptographic scheme, authentication is needed to authenticate the entities involved in the comunication. In other words, authentication assure that messages received by Bob are for sure from Alice.\\
To ensure authentication hash functions are used and that's why, in general, authentication imply integrity (but the opposite is not true).

% Even if we have defined hash functions as functions with an infinite domain, in practice they are first constructed to be \emph{fixed-length}, that means their domain is finite, then they are extended to cover the full domain ${0,1}^{*}$.\\
% This extension is made easy by the Merkle-Damg\r{a}rd transform which also preserve the collision resistant propriety.\\
% We will denote the given fixed-length collision-resistant hash function (or \emph{compression function}) by $\mathsf{Gen}_h, h)$ and use it to construct a general collision-resistant hash function $(\mathsf{Gen}, H)$ that maps inputs of any length to outputs of length $l(n)$.\\
% Let $\mathsf{Gen}_h, h)$ be a fixed-length hash function with input length $2l(n)$ and output $l(n)$. Construct a variable-length hash function $(\mathsf{Gen}, H)$ as follow:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item{$\mathsf{Gen}(n)$: upon input $n$, run the key-generation algorithm $\mathsf{Gen}_h$. $s \leftarrow \mathsf{Gen}_h$.}
%     \item{$H^s(x)$: upon input key $s$ and message $x \in {0, 1}^{*}$, compute as follows:
%         \begin{enumerate}
%             \item{Pad $x$ with zeroes until it's length is a multiple of $l(n)$. Let $L = |x|$ (length of the string) and let $B = \ceil[\Big]{\frac{L}{l(n)}}$ (number of blocks of length $l(n)$).}
%             \item{Define $z_0 := 0^{l(n)}$ and then $\forall i = 1,...,B$, compute:
%                 $$
%                     z_i := h^s(z_{i-1}||x_i)
%                 $$
%                 where $h^s$ is the given fixed-length hash function.}
%             \item{Output $z = H^s(z_B||L)$.}
%         \end{enumerate}}
% \end{itemize}
% We remark that the value $z_0$, also known as \emph{IV} or \emph{initialization vector} can be replaced with any costant of length $l(n)$ bits.

% \subsection{Message Authentication Code (MAC)}
% A message authentication codes, also know as \emph{tags}, are small string used to authenticate a message and to protect its integrity
