\section{Authentication}
In a cryptographic scheme, authentication is needed to authenticate the entities involved in the communication. In other words, authentication assures that messages received by Bob are for sure from Alice.\\
To ensure authentication hash functions are used and that's why, in general, authentication implies integrity (but the opposite is not true).

\subsection{Message Authentication Code (MAC)}
Message authentication codes, also known as \emph{tags}, are small strings used to authenticate a message and to protect its integrity and confidentiality.\\
